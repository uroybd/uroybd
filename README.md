# I am Utsob Roy,
### A programmer, writer, and thought criminal.

I mostly code in Python, TypeScript, and Rust. In writing, I enjoy doing experiments while not publishing them at all. I'm a **thought criminal** in the Orwellian sense.

### In my leisure...
I like to contribute in opensource projects, solve problems, and listen to not too noisy music. I would have added reading here, however, that is my default mode of existence. I enjoy making unnecessary cool things. You can find one such at [CyberEns≈ç](https://enso.utsob.me).

### Significant part of my digital footprint consists of...
A website acommpanied by 2 blogs at [utsob.me](https://utsob.me), a email address where you can send even encrypted emails: [connect@utsob.me](mailto:connect@utsob.me), a <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@uroybd">FOSStodon/Mastodon</a> account where I'm active.
