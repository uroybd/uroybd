# I am Utsob Roy,
**A programmer, writer, and thought criminal.**

I mostly code in Python, TypeScript, and Rust. In writing, I enjoy doing experiments while not publishing them at all. I'm a _thought criminal_ in the Orwellian sense. I agree with Socrates on the fact that an unexamined life is not worth living.
### In my leisure...
I like to contribute to open-source projects, solve problems, and listen to not-too-noisy music. I would have added reading here, however, that is my default mode of existence. I enjoy making unnecessary cool things. You can find one such at [CyberEns≈ç](https://enso.utsob.me).

### Significant part of my digital footprint consists of...
A website accompanied by 2 blogs at [utsob.me](https://utsob.me), a [digital garden](https://hermitage.utsob.me), an email address where you can send even encrypted emails: [connect@utsob.me](mailto:connect@utsob.me), a <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@uroybd">FOSStodon/Mastodon</a> account where I'm active.

**Live long an prosper!** üññ
